Name of the project
Additional information or tagline

A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get awesome when someone starts to use it.

Installing / Getting started
A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.

packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

Initial Configuration
Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, npm i). This is the section where you would document those requirements.

Developing
Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing the project further:

git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
And state what happens step-by-step.

Building
If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, state them here:

./configure
make
make install
Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets executed.

Deploying / Publishing
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, this is the right time to state it.

packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

Features
What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?

What's the main functionality

If you get really randy, you can even do this
Configuration
Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

Argument 1
Type: String
Default: 'default value'

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide an example below.

Example:

awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
Argument 2
Type: Number|Boolean
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

Contributing
When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called CONTRIBUTING.md (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

Links
Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort to improve the security and privacy of this project!

Licensing
One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license. Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."

This is a collaboration project with Easy-Peasy.
The objective is to add a comment form and to show comments from other users in the detial section of each games and to retrieve feedback about user satisfaction.
We are using React to develop this features.

Dependencies:
prop-types,
node-sass,
react-html-parser,
react-router-dom,


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
